# Face-Recognition-Using-PCA
Principal component Analysis can be used for many purposes we found some of them are to decrease the computational complexity and measure of the covariance between the images. PCA reduces the complexity of computation when there is large number of database of images. These principal components of the Eigen vector of this covariance matrix when concatenated and converted gives the Eigen faces. These Eigen faces are the ghostly faces of the trained set of faces form a face space. This distance gives the location of the image in the Eigen space, which is taken as the output matched image.

# We Learned
1. If the Initial Features (F_bar) are changed accuracy changes
2. Affine Transformations are used to map images
3. Image can be represented in a vector form using reshae in MATLAB
4. If the intensity of the image pixels correlation increases it reduces its dimensions reduce by projecting along the vector using PCA
5. Data of the give images are easy to do face reorganization but some false data causes troubles
6. If we take covariance matrix as A*A’ it leads to higher dimensions takes more time for computing
7. Learned many inbuilt matlab commands and their uses.
8. If there is any wrong data in the given images responsible for the accuracy.
9. Shows an example how applied math’s is used in various fields.
